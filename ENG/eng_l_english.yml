    nf_eng_1_title:0 "The Setting Sun of the British"
    nf_eng_1_desc:0 "In the long history of the world there was no Empire that could compare to that of the British Empire. As it conquered the Waves and half off the Globe. Spreading the Culture of the British around the World and making English the most spoken language in the World. Yet History repeats itself and every Empire must come crumbling down. The downturn of the British Empire began when the Germans began the London Blitz, and that had led to Britain joining the War. Making the once great empire only a hollow husk of its former self. As the Government had struggled to keep the peace allowing crime to go rampant and Political Radicalism to go untouched. Winston Churchill tried to fix the crisis but it was too late as he was assassinated in 1947. In the same year, PM David Chambers was elected and pushed forward very Anti-Communist, Militaristic, and Isolationist Views upon Britain. As in 1950, PM Chambers and Minister of National Security and Intelligence Borthy signed a Proclamation that led to the complete isolation of Britain to the World known as Brexit. Due to this Isolation the rest of the Colonies entered into a period of chaos and revolution. The Colonial Governments of the Colonies in Africa and the British Raj had fallen during the years of 1951-1954. Since then the Empire has been on decline and the order that Chambers and Borthy established was constantly under threat. By proxy the Monarchy itself was under threat until recently."
    nf_eng_1_a:0 "God Bless Britain?"
    nf_eng_2_title:0 "The Century of Sorrow"
    nf_eng_2_desc:0 "The World has fallen into an international resource crisis, and the United Kingdom isn’t different. This is one of many reasons for the Century of Sorrows. In 2026, our Coal Reserves in Northern England and Scotland had been mined down to the very last ore. Leading to a Transportation Crisis as more rural parts of Britain still used Coal Powered Engine to transport goods. It also caused mass unemployment due to the Mines being closed down for obvious reasons. This one event had cascaded into many other disasters such as the re-emergence of the Red Syndrome and Borthymanderism and Factionalism within parliament. The only good thing to come out of this was that the Atomic Powered Vehicle had become more popular and also caused Britain to break total isolationism to trade with America. Bringing American Products like Nuka-Cola and some types of Corvega to the Isles. While another crisis is on the Horizon waiting to make our situation worse."
    nf_eng_2_a:0 "Oh Bollocks!"
    nf_eng_3_title:0 "The Queen and The Devil"
    nf_eng_3_desc:0 "Since the Rise of Borthyism, it has been a common fear among the Royals and the Parliament that Borthyism would overcome British Politics. It did not take very long for them to do so as when the Century of Sorrow began it had become a ginormous stepping stone for Borthymanderers. In 2028, The Newly elected PM Kyle Dunderby had issued an Emergency Government during this crisis. King Zacherary of Britain did not oppose the Man and it had lead to 28 Years of Borthyist Supremacy. Although Zacherary died leaving the throne to his Oldest, Elizabeth III, a shimmer of Change as she began a war against Borthymanderism. However, Stuart Maxim Braxby stands in her way. Who wants to sustain the Borthymanderer’s control over Britain. He wants to rule alone and will do anything to achieve that goal. This rivalry will lead to the Clash of the Century as we’ll soon see the Future of Britain. Will it ascend to Paradise? Or will it be the cause of Hell on earth?"
