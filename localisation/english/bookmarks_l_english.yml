    DDR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "The peace talks which would've seen the unification of West and East Germany in the 1990s fell apart just as fast as the USSR did initially, the government now left adrift in the international community as the only nations they even really interacted with diplomatically remained the former satellite states of the USSR. When the Soviets returned to "liberate" Eastern Europe, Eastern Germany allowed them in with open arms, the few reforms they'd pushed to stabilize their situation being repeeled quickly as a pro-Soviet government was once more established, little actually changing for them throughout the decades, past that of the political climate which, following the initial collapse of the USSR, saw the rise of political extremism in conservative and liberal circles, Republican and Nationalist ideals returning to the once scarred German people as groups like the Monarchist movement began rapidly gaining popularity. It has been due to this that East Germany's situation has become so precarious, one bad move by the government capable of lighting their control ablaze as they walk a fine line between blatant totalitarianism and Republican idealism."
