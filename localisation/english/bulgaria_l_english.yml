And the unlucky victim does not die immediately, it goes through long stages of interrogation and torture, if the victim of course will be suspected of atni-government views. But no one knows where, or how it all happens. Maybe it's a lie, but it's probably a rumor started by the government. For reasons unknown."

### EVENTS ###
bulgaria.1.t:0 "People's Republic of Bulgaria"
bulgaria.1.d:0 "The People's Republic of Bulgaria, established in the previous century, has demonstrated remarkable resilience despite encountering numerous obstacles throughout its history. The nation successfully navigated periods of unrest and political dissent primarily due to the transformative governance model implemented by Nikul Vasilev upon his ascension to leadership in 2047. His administration ushered in a period of stability for Bulgaria. \n\nHowever, a new challenge has emerged: an agricultural crisis that originated in 2054 following radical economic reforms which destabilized the nation's agricultural sector. This upheaval has resulted in a significant decline in food production and disproportionately impacted rural communities. \n\nCompounding these internal difficulties is a diplomatic impasse with neighboring nations Yugoslavia and Greece. Nevertheless, Bulgaria enjoys the support of the USSR, placing it in a favorable position to safeguard its strategic interests within the Balkans and maintain regional influence for the foreseeable future. \n\nThe situation remains precarious."
bulgaria.1.a:0 "Everything's going according to plan, almost everything"

bulgaria.2.t:0 "Agricultural reform"
bulgaria.2.d:0 "The socialist government of Bulgaria took decisive action to address the nation's agricultural crisis by distributing modern machinery and technology to farming regions across the country. While this initiative did not fully resolve the agricultural issues, it significantly alleviated the crisis and improved productivity. Today, a variety of popular products have begun to reappear on store shelves in the cities, while trucks are once again delivering goods to the rural areas. This marks a significant step towards revitalizing the agricultural sector and ensuring food security for all Bulgarians."
bulgaria.2.a:0 "Eat while you can"

bulgaria.3.t:0 "Bulgarian Dream"
bulgaria.3.d:0 "Ferdinand, a young officer in the Bulgarian People's Army, stood before the office door of Nikul Vasilev, the leader of the Bulgarian People's Republic. One autumn day, Ferdinand was astonished to receive an appointment to a position of great significance, a role he felt ill-equipped to fill. As a simple officer, he questioned the rationale behind his selection. \n\nEntering the room, Ferdinand found Nikul seated at a leather desk, engrossed in writing. As Nikul looked up, a warm smile spread across his face. Their conversation proceeded as usual until Nikul posed a thought-provoking question: "Ferdinand, what do you believe is my ultimate goal? Of course, the establishment of a Great Bulgarian Communism is paramount, but I seek a more concrete answer... What is my dream? My aspiration?" \n\nFerdinand, uncertain of the correct response, remained silent. Nikul waited patiently, then, with a radiant smile, declared, "I yearn to leave an indelible mark on history. I want to be remembered even after the cataclysm of nuclear war, the end of the world. And the means by which I shall achieve this immortality, you will soon discover.""
