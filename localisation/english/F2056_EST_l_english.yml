EST_defend_our_independence_idea:0 "Defending our independence"
EST_defend_our_independence_idea_desc:0 "The defense of Estonian independence is paramount. We must stand firm against the Communists, refusing to yield even an inch of ground. Every Estonian must be prepared to defend our homeland against the Bolshevik horde. The choice is clear: an independent Estonia or death. \n\nOur uprising, launched late last year, has successfully destabilized the Russians. We have ignited a flame that must spread throughout the USSR. Although we were forced to retreat to Tallinn, there is no reason why we cannot inflict maximum casualties on the enemy before succumbing. Let us make them pay a heavy price for their aggression!"
EST_proud_small_nation:0 "A Small but Proud Nation"
EST_proud_small_nation_desc:0 "Before joining the USSR, Estonia was a small but proud country that strived to maintain its independence and culture despite pressure from larger powers. Estonian society was cohesive, with a strong emphasis on education, stability, and sustainable development. Now, having regained its independence once more, Estonia stands as a testament to resilience—a small but fiercely proud nation."
