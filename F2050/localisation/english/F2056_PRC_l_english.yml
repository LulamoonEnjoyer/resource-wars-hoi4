 prc.1.t:0 "ANOTHER DAY IN SHANGHAI"
 prc.1.d:0 "Li Jongpin has always been an early starter. A straight-forward man, a hard worker who owned a slice of life in Shanghai. China was under the CCP, this is true, but the Chinese weren't, atleast in Shanghai. Li Jongpin, a great officeman, atleast his supervisor said. Li worked for the Ministry of Water Resources, specifically the Office of State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters. He was relatively well known in this circle for his actions during the flooding of Wuxi County in the Spring of 51. In all, Li was basic. Truthfully, he had nothing interesting. He read basic weather reports, consulted with those in the region, followed upon warnings and, quite frankly, did his job. He was a true citizen, through and through. No vices for Li, for he could both not afford or nor succumb to it. He lived in his apartment and office, rarely he went to dinner for departmental issues. The News say otherwise, though. A great revolutionary who saved thousands, targeted by American saboteurs. Fairly, they weren't entirely off. The United States did, afterall, have major sway in the Chinese Smuggler sphere. The truth? Li wondered too far off the Golden Brick road. After a late night of drinking and eating with his superiors at Xilao's Corner Food Dispensary, a restuarant by western terms. Too much Bao Bao Pork Buns and Qingdao Beer, he told himself. Not drunk by any means, but neither sober, he stumbled through the streets of Shanghai. Cityblock F42, his state mandated apartment building, was on the coast. He considered himself lucky, afterall, he had such a great view of the sea! But sadly, one too many steps too far left, a few steps too few to the road, and Li found himself in a sort of conundrum. Shanghai was a great City! And every great City had its many sins. And for Li, he has found the center of it. Smugglers have always plagued Shanghai for its life time. Now is no different. In Shanghai, Western Media, Drugs such as Amphetamines for the Office Drones Shanghai is full of, and Weaponry for those who could afford it were rampant. For Li? He had found himself in the worst of them all, the smuggling of Western Media. China and the West, oh so close yet so far. For afficionado's, Western media such as, well, Westerns, as well as Comics, various media, and other Western oriented goods were the most sought after, and dangerous, of Shanghai. Here? The Man from Deadhorse was being ransomed to several rich benefactors, ranging from polticians, to managers, to Military Officials, to CCP Officials! And sadly, Li was not on the list. A string of insults and accusations, accusing Li of being an agent from the Ministry of State Security, led to a brutal shootout. And sadly for Li Jongping, he was its only casualty. A stray round struck his chest, causing his collapse in the alley. Unluckily for those who participated, he was brought to a hospital. An even more unluckily, Li's wound was fatal. But his words were echoed throughout all of China. Able to report of the events of said meeting, albeitly only partially, the true details of the Shanghai smuggling scene were finally brought to Chinese Media. Despite this all, Li would only be able to utter a few more words: 'Smugglers lay at our doorstep... West... Lays at our doorstep' And so were those, the final words of Li Jongping, another recipient of Shanghai's underworld."
